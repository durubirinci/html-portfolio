<h1> The Best Movies According to Duru (hehe)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Drive (2011)</h3>
<p>I like this because it has ryan gosling in it, and he drives.</p>

<h3> Kiki's Delivery Service</h3>
<p> I like this because it's a cute story with cats.</p>

<h3> La La Land</h3>
<p>I like this despite it being a musical because it's ryan gosling, and the story is nice.</p>
